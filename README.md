# Jenga Tower
It all started at a house party with friends. We were immersed in a game of Jenga, taking turns to remove blocks from a tower. As I watched the tower swaying with every move, inspiration hit me—this was the spark for my next game idea. In that moment, I knew exactly what I wanted to create.

Jenga Tower is a Unity multiplayer mobile 3D game that I designed and built on my own.

I started this project as a creative outlet, and it’s been a rewarding journey bringing my ideas to life. I’m excited to share it with you, whether you're here to dive into the code or just enjoy playing the game.
